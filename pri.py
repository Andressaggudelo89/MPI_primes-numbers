    The coming piece of code is like the base case
    Process 0 (root) will control everything, it'll send numbers 
    to the other processes to check id they're prime or not.
    Root will not make calculations.
    When a process end calculating a number, send info back to root
    and then when root gets this, it sends another number to that process
    In this first part, root sends and do no receives anything back (it does but
    on the general block code inside the 'while loop' which will iterate while
    aux <= n).

When the last round of numbers is being calculated,
I do not need to get an answer from other processes to root
You'll not find a line sending info to root inside the 'else'

    I could not get at what moment inside the loop above,
    when to stop sending answer back to root.
    I made it easy (not as good) and made another specific case below.
